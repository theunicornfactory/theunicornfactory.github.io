  This was a massive undertaking by our studio, spanning almost the whole year
  </p>
  <p>
    We engaged film production companies for the promotional video (in order for Kuggle to get into the AppWorks 11 incubator batch), engaged multiple frontend developers to build the interface, as well as flesh out a loadbalanced backend infrastructure for scaling.
