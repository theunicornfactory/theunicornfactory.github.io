description: The app was a product to raise awareness for Toyota's 4WD product line. It is an augmented reality app that utilized high tech GPS and GEO fencing capabilities with gamification. Challenges included balancing battery drain with the heavy use of GPS. We were responsible for app front and back end as well as UX/UI design. We collaborated with Saatchi and Saatchi who helped to market the app after its launch.
