  <p>
    Itinerant Foodie is travel and food blog since 2014. The site around 2016 was looking a bit dated and was looking for a redesign.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not only that but the database backend it was running on was being retired, so the challenge was to get most of the new pages off the database and using Jekyll for static site generation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another cool feature is that the site is auto-deploying through travisCI upon github commit simplifying the time to creating content.
  </p>
  <p>
    The end result? I page which looked a bit better and not to mention ran faster.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project is fully open source on github.
